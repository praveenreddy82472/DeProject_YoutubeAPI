@YashTobre-n5w,"Okay @Darshil Parmar I tried this project using youtube API on a MacBook. The first thing was it said that the permissions for the key are too open so I had to use chmod 600 to go through and make that ssh connection. Afterwards, I tried using the free tier and install airflow but it was showing me some error because of which I had to create an virtual environment within the machine to install airflow, I did that. (the other option was using pipx but it had some other errors so I had to give up on that) afterwards I made sure that I installed all the dependencies on the virtual environment as well, then I edited the inbound rules to make sure I select all traffic -  my IP and all traffic - anywhere ipv4, it did not work. I do not know why. I tried with the paid tier the t3 medium that you used it still did not work. Can you help me out here?
